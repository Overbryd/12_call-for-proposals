# RuPy 12 Conf - Call For Proposals

RuPy is a unique conference that brings together communities from different 
state-of-the-art programming languages: Ruby, Python and JavaScript. We think 
that the interaction between these communities can be very fruitful.

Join us during RuPy 12 in Brno or in Sao Paulo.

We really like advanced topics. :)

## How to submit a proposal 

1. Fork this repository.
2. Change the name of `example/` folder to `your_name-talk_name/`.
3. Edit the `README.md` file by filling gaps.
4. Add your picture inside (max 150px width).
5. Send us a pull request. 

Accepted talks will be merged in.
